**News Sentiment Analysis**

**Project Description**

This project involves performing sentiment analysis on a collection of news articles. The sentiment of each article is classified as positive, neutral, or negative based on the text content. The sentiment analysis is done using the VADER sentiment analysis tool, which is well-suited for social media and news content.

**Features**

- Collects news articles from various sources.
- Extracts relevant information such as source, author, title, description, URL, and published date.
- Performs sentiment analysis on the articles.
- Classifies the sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative.
- Outputs the data in a structured format including sentiment scores and labels.
- Usage

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pandas library
- nltk library with VADER
- (Optional) Virtual environment setup

**New Knowledge**

**Pandas**

Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It is particularly well-suited for working with structured data such as CSV files. Here are some key functionalities used in this project:

- Reading data: Using pd.read_csv() to load data from a CSV file.
- Data manipulation: Using DataFrame methods to filter, sort, and modify data.
- Exporting data: Using to_csv() to save the processed data back to a CSV file.

**Sentiment Analysis**

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a body of text. It is commonly used in natural language processing (NLP) to identify the sentiment expressed in text data.

In this project, the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool is used for sentiment analysis. VADER is a lexicon and rule-based sentiment analysis tool that is specifically attuned to sentiments expressed in social media.

**Sentiment Scores: VADER provides four sentiment scores:**

neg: Negative sentiment score

neu: Neutral sentiment score

pos: Positive sentiment score

compound: A normalized, weighted composite score.

**Sentiment Label: Based on the compound score, a sentiment label is assigned:**

Positive (compound >= 0.05)

Neutral (-0.05 < compound < 0.05)

Negative (compound <= -0.05)

**When to Use Virtual Environments**

Using virtual environments is highly recommended for Python projects for several reasons:

- Dependency Management: Ensures that dependencies for your project are isolated from other projects. Different projects can require different versions of the same library.
- Avoiding Conflicts: Prevents conflicts between different versions of libraries that might be required by different projects.
- Reproducibility: Makes it easier to reproduce your development environment, which is especially useful when sharing your project with others or deploying it to production.
